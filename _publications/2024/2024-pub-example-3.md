abstract: >-
  Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurological disorder that significantly impacts the nervous system and leads to long-term suffering. Early detection is crucial for improving prognosis and halting the disease's progression. Traditional machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. However, conventional ML approaches confronted two major challenges: the demand for substantial computational resources and limitations in data sharing due to privacy concerns. This study employed a novel Xception-based model FedX that integrated within a federated learning (FL) framework to address these challenges. FedX ensures collaborative learning across distributed data sources and it preserves user privacy, which makes it a promising solution for healthcare applications. We separated the dataset into five unique client-oriented subsets from the Parkinson's Brain MRI Dataset, while each client conducted five rounds of evaluation to mitigate overfitting risks. The proposed model successfully detects Parkinson's disease and achieved a 96.82% accuracy, while maintaining data privacy and security. The integrated FedX approach demonstrates significant performance in privacy-preserving diagnostics approaches compared to traditional models. These results suggest that federated learning could change the way cognitive disorders are found and diagnosed early, which would make it possible to improve healthcare technologies in a way that is both safe and scalable.
