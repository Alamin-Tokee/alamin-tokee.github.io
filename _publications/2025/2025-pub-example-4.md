  This study presents a Transformer-based deep learning framework for the analysis and classification of gastric cancer subtypes using high-dimensional gene expression data. 
#   Initially, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving local neighborhood structures for better interpretability. K-means clustering was then applied to the t-SNE embeddings, identifying three distinct clusters that may represent underlying biological subtypes. These cluster labels were used as auxiliary information to guide supervised learning. To mitigate class imbalance, an upsampling technique was applied, ensuring a more balanced distribution of samples across subtypes. The Transformer model, utilizing self-attention mechanisms, effectively captured complex gene-gene relationships and long-range dependencies within the expression data. Experimental results demonstrated strong classification performance, with the model achieving an accuracy of 98.07%, highlighting the potential of this approach for reliable subtype differentiation and biomarker discovery in gastric cancer research.
