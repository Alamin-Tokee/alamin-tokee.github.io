abstract: >-
  Leukemia is a common type of blood cancer that can occur in people of any age. Detecting it early and diagnosing it correctly are very important for successful treatment and better recovery. This study presents a simplified machine learning pipeline for analyzing leukemia cancer subtypes using high-dimensional gene expression data. Initially, variance-based filtering was applied to remove low-information genes, preserving discriminative features for better model performance. Univariate feature selection using ANOVA F-test identified the top 30 genes, followed by t-tests to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for biomarker discovery. For leveraging balanced class weights to address subtype imbalance, machine learning models ware utilized to capture gene expression patterns. Experimental results showed strong performance, achieving 98% accuracy and 99% weighted F1-score for Support Vector Machine(SVM). This research project supports reliable leukemia subtype classification and biomarker discovery, advancing precision oncology.
